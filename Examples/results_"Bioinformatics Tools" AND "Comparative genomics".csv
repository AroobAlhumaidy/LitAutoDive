This will allow intraspecies comparative genomics studies as well as functional genomics studies aimed at a better understanding of physiological processes and regulatory networks operating in lactococci. This paper describes the initial set-up of a DNA-microarray facility in our group, to enable transcriptome analysis of various Gram-positive bacteria, including a ssp. lactis and a ssp. cremoris strain of Lactococcus lactis. Moreover a global description will be given of the hardware and software requirements for such a set-up, highlighting the crucial integration of relevant bioinformatics tools and methods.

"""Bioinformatics Tools"" AND ""Comparative genomics""",12369206,Comparative genomics of phages and prophages in lactic acid bacteria.,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,"Comparative phage genomics has become possible due to the availability of more than 100 complete phage genome sequences and the development of powerful bioinformatics tools. This technology, profiting from classical molecular-biology knowledge, has opened avenues of research for topics, which were difficult to address in the past. Now, it is possible to retrace part of the evolutionary history of phage modules by comparative genomics. The diagnosis of relatedness is hereby not uniquely based on sequence similarity alone, but includes topological considerations of genome organization. Detailed transcription maps have allowed in silico predictions of genome organization to be verified and refined. This comparative knowledge is providing the basis for a new taxonomic classification concept for bacteriophages infecting low G + C-content Gram-positive bacteria based on the genetic organization of the structural gene module. An Sfi21-like and an Sfi11-like genus of Siphoviridae is proposed. The gene maps of many phages show remarkable synteny in their structural genes defining a lambda super-group within Siphoviridae. A hierarchy of relatedness within the lambda super-group suggests elements of vertical evolution in Siphoviridae. Tailed phages are the result of both vertical and horizontal evolution and are thus fascinating objects for the study of molecular evolution. Prophage sequences integrated into the genomes of their bacterial host present theoretical challenges for evolutionary biologists. Prophages represent up to 10% of the genome in some LAB. In pathogenic streptococci prophages confer genes of selective value for the lysogenic cell. The lysogenic conversion genes are located between the lysin gene and the right phage attachment site. Non-attributed genes were found at the same genome position of prophages from lactic streptococci. These genes belong to the few prophage genes transcribed in the lysogen. Prophages from dairy bacteria might therefore also contribute to the evolutionary fitness of non-pathogenic LAB.",2002 Aug

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences","The last two decades have witnessed significant expansions in the databases storing information on the sequences and structures of proteins. This has led to the creation of many excellent protein family resources, which classify proteins according to their evolutionary relationship. These have allowed extensive insights into evolution and particularly how protein function mutates and evolves over time. Such analyses have greatly assisted the inheritance of functional annotations between experimentally characterised and uncharacterised genes. Moreover, the development of bioinformatics tools acts as a companion to the new technologies emerging in biology, such as transcriptomics and proteomics. The latter enable researchers to analyse gene expression profiles and interactions on a genome-wide scale, generating vast datasets of proteins, many of which include experimentally uncharacterised proteins. Protein family/function databases can be used to help interpret this data and allow us to benefit more fully from these technologies. This review aims to summarise the most popular sequence- and structure-based protein family databases. We also cover their application to comparative genomics and the functional annotation of the genomes.",2005 Feb 5

These types of studies have the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of diseases such as liver cancer in humans. Genes co-expressed across multiple species are most likely to have conserved functions. We have used various bioinformatics approaches to examine microarray expression profiles from liver neoplasms that arise in albumin-SV40 transgenic rats to elucidate genes, chromosome aberrations and pathways that might be associated with human liver cancer. RESULTS: In this study, we first identified 2223 differentially expressed genes by comparing gene expression profiles for two control, two adenoma and two carcinoma samples using an F-test. These genes were subsequently mapped to the rat chromosomes using a novel visualization tool, the Chromosome Plot. Using the same plot, we further mapped the significant genes to orthologous chromosomal locations in human and mouse. Many genes expressed in rat 1q that are amplified in rat liver cancer map to the human chromosomes 10, 11 and 19 and to the mouse chromosomes 7, 17 and 19, which have been implicated in studies of human and mouse liver cancer. Using Comparative Genomics Microarray Analysis (CGMA), we identified regions of potential aberrations in human. Lastly, a pathway analysis was conducted to predict altered human pathways based on statistical analysis and extrapolation from the rat data. All of the identified pathways have been known to be important in the etiology of human liver cancer, including cell cycle control, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and protein metabolism. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that the hepatic gene expression profiles from the albumin-SV40 transgenic rat model revealed genes, pathways and chromosome alterations consistent with experimental and clinical research in human liver cancer. The bioinformatics tools presented in this paper are essential for cross species extrapolation and mapping of microarray data, its analysis and interpretation.",2005 Jul 15

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis has been performed in both humans and mice. So far, approximately 40 high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-regulating QTLs have been identified in each species. To compare human and mouse HDL-C QTLs, we generate human-mouse comparative chromosome maps based on homologous genes in humans and mice. The comparative maps reveal that most human and mouse HDL-C QTLs are concordant, which suggests that identifying the underlying QTL genes in mice will facilitate identifying their homologs in humans. The maps also help to narrow QTLs by mouse-human homologous QTL comparison. By using a combination of classic genetic approaches and newer bioinformatics tools (including comparative genomics as highlighted in this study), identifying new drug targets for plasma HDL-C levels holds more promise than ever.",2006 Oct

An increasing number of expressed sequence tag (EST) data and EST- or genomic-derived microsatellite markers have been generated, together with Conserved Ortholog Set (COS) markers. This considerably facilitates comparative genomics or map-based genetic studies through the common use of orthologous loci across different species. Similar genomic information is available for e.g. tomato or potato, members of the Solanaceae family. Since both Rubiaceae and Solanaceae belong to the Euasterids I (lamiids) integration of information on genetic markers would be possible and lead to more efficient analyses and discovery of key loci involved in important traits such as fruit development, quality, and maturation, or adaptation. Our goal was to develop a comprehensive web data source for integrated information on validated orthologous markers in Rubiaceae. DESCRIPTION: MoccaDB is an online MySQL-PHP driven relational database that houses annotated and/or mapped microsatellite markers in Rubiaceae. In its current release, the database stores 638 markers that have been defined on 259 ESTs and 379 genomic sequences. Marker information was retrieved from 11 published works, and completed with original data on 132 microsatellite markers validated in our laboratory. DNA sequences were derived from three Coffea species/hybrids. Microsatellite markers were checked for similarity, in vitro tested for cross-amplification and diversity/polymorphism status in up to 38 Rubiaceae species belonging to the Cinchonoideae and Rubioideae subfamilies. Functional annotation was provided and some markers associated with described metabolic pathways were also integrated. Users can search the database for marker, sequence, map or diversity information through multi-option query forms. The retrieved data can be browsed and downloaded, along with protocols used, using a standard web browser. MoccaDB also integrates bioinformatics tools (CMap viewer and local BLAST) and hyperlinks to related external data sources (NCBI GenBank and PubMed, SOL Genomic Network database).

Recent technological advancements have assisted in the development of comparative genomic approaches, which rely on the combination of human and rodent datasets and bioinformatics tools, followed by the narrowing of concordant loci and improved identification of candidate genes and genetic variants. Additionally, candidate genes and genetic variants identified by these methods have been further validated and functionally investigated in animal models, a process that is not feasible in humans.

The purpose of this article is to explore the challenges, opportunities, and research needs surrounding the issue of how genomics data and computational and systems level approaches can be applied to inform differences in response to environmental chemical exposure across species. We propose that the data, tools, and evolutionary framework of comparative genomics be adapted to inform interspecies differences in chemical mechanisms of action.

A draft genome sequence consisting of 100 contigs has been published. RESULTS: A closed, high-quality genome sequence for C. autoethanogenum DSM10061 was generated using only the latest single-molecule DNA sequencing technology and without the need for manual finishing. It is assigned to the most complex genome classification based upon genome features such as repeats, prophage, nine copies of the rRNA gene operons. It has a low G + C content of 31.1%. Illumina, 454, Illumina/454 hybrid assemblies were generated and then compared to the draft and PacBio assemblies using summary statistics, CGAL, QUAST and REAPR bioinformatics tools and comparative genomic approaches. Assemblies based upon shorter read DNA technologies were confounded by the large number repeats and their size, which in the case of the rRNA gene operons were ~5 kb. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Paloindromic Repeats) systems among biotechnologically relevant Clostridia were classified and related to plasmid content and prophages. Potential associations between plasmid content and CRISPR systems may have implications for historical industrial scale Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) fermentation failures and future large scale bacterial fermentations. While C. autoethanogenum contains an active CRISPR system, no such system is present in the closely related Clostridium ljungdahlii DSM 13528. A common prophage inserted into the Arg-tRNA shared between the strains suggests a common ancestor. However, C. ljungdahlii contains several additional putative prophages and it has more than double the amount of prophage DNA compared to C. autoethanogenum. Other differences include important metabolic genes for central metabolism (as an additional hydrogenase and the absence of a phophoenolpyruvate synthase) and substrate utilization pathway (mannose and aromatics utilization) that might explain phenotypic differences between C. autoethanogenum and C. ljungdahlii.

From October 2012 to May 2015 the number of verified ORFs had only risen from 75.31% to 78%, while the number of uncharacterized ORFs had decreased from 12.8% to 11% (representing > 700 genes still left in this category; http://www.yeastgenome.org/genomesnapshot). Course-based research has been shown to increase student learning while providing experience with real scientific investigation; however, implementation in large, multi-section courses presents many challenges. This study sought to test the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating authentic research into a core genetics course, with multiple instructors, to increase student learning and progress our understanding of uncharacterized ORFs. We generated a module-based annotation toolkit and utilized easily accessible bioinformatics tools to predict gene function for uncharacterized ORFs within the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). Students were each assigned an uncharacterized ORF, which they annotated using contemporary comparative genomics methodologies, including multiple sequence alignment, conserved domain identification, signal peptide prediction and cellular localization algorithms. Student learning outcomes were measured by quizzes, project reports and presentations, as well as a post-project questionnaire.

The draft genome sequence for the R. solani AG1-IB isolate 7/3/14 as well as a corresponding transcriptome dataset (Expressed Sequence Tags--ESTs) were established previously. Development of a specific R. solani AG1-IB gene model based on GMAP transcript mapping within the eukaryotic gene prediction platform AUGUSTUS allowed detection of new genes and provided insights into the gene structure of this fungus. In total, 12,616 genes were recognized in the genome of the AG1-IB isolate. Analysis of predicted genes by means of different bioinformatics tools revealed new genes whose products potentially are involved in degradation of plant cell wall components, melanin formation and synthesis of secondary metabolites. Comparative genome analyses between members of different R. solani anastomosis groups, namely AG1-IA, AG3 and AG8 and the newly annotated R. solani AG1-IB genome were performed within the comparative genomics platform EDGAR. It appeared that only 21 to 28% of all genes encoded in the draft genomes of the different strains were identified as core genes. Based on Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and Average Amino-acid Identity (AAI) analyses, considerable sequence differences between isolates representing different anastomosis groups were identified. However, R. solani isolates form a distinct cluster in relation to other fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota.

While there are number of excellent tools developed for performing this task, most scale poorly when faced with hundreds of genome sequences, and many require extensive manual curation. RESULTS: We have developed a de-novo genome analysis pipeline (DeNoGAP) for the automated, iterative and high-throughput analysis of data from comparative genomics projects involving hundreds of whole genome sequences. The pipeline is designed to perform reference-assisted and de novo gene prediction, homolog protein family assignment, ortholog prediction, functional annotation, and pan-genome analysis using a range of proven tools and databases. While most existing methods scale quadratically with the number of genomes since they rely on pairwise comparisons among predicted protein sequences, DeNoGAP scales linearly since the homology assignment is based on iteratively refined hidden Markov models. This iterative clustering strategy enables DeNoGAP to handle a very large number of genomes using minimal computational resources. Moreover, the modular structure of the pipeline permits easy updates as new analysis programs become available. CONCLUSION: DeNoGAP integrates bioinformatics tools and databases for comparative analysis of a large number of genomes. The pipeline offers tools and algorithms for annotation and analysis of completed and draft genome sequences. The pipeline is developed using Perl, BioPerl and SQLite on Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 LTS. Currently, the software package accompanies script for automated installation of necessary external programs on Ubuntu Linux; however, the pipeline should be also compatible with other Linux and Unix systems after necessary external programs are installed.

"""Bioinformatics Tools"" AND ""Comparative genomics""",27499678,Enhancement of Plant Productivity in the Post-Genomics Era.,Current genomics,"Obtaining high plant yield is not always achievable in agricultural activity as it is determined by various factors, including cultivar quality, nutrient and water supplies, degree of infection by pathogens, natural calamities and soil conditions, which affect plant growth and development. More noticeably, sustainable plant productivity to provide sufficient food for the increasing human population has become a thorny issue to scientists in the era of unpredictable global climatic changes, appearance of more tremendous or multiple stresses, and land restriction for cultivation. Well-established agricultural management by agrotechnological means has shown no longer to be effective enough to confront with this challenge. Instead, in order to maximize the production, it is advisable to implement such practices in combination with biological applications. Nowadays, high technologies are widely adopted into agricultural production, biological diversity conservation and crop improvement. Wang et al. has nicely outlined the utilization of DNA-based technologies in this field. Among these are the applications of (i) DNA markers into cultivar identification, seed purity analysis, germplasm resource evaluation, heterosis prediction, genetic mapping, cloning and breeding; and (ii) gene expression data in supporting the description of crop phenology, the analytic comparison of crop growth under stress versus non-stress conditions, or the study of fertilizer effects. Besides, various purposes of using transgenic technologies in agriculture, such as generating cultivars with better product quality, better tolerance to biotic or abiotic stress, are also discussed in the review. One of the important highlights in this issue is the review of the benefits brought by high-throughput sequencing technology, which is also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS). It is not so difficult to recognize that its application has allowed us to carry out biological studies at much deeper level and larger scale. In their article, Onda and Mochida detailed how to use these technologies in fully characterizing the genetic diversity or multigenecity within a particular plant species. The authors discussed the constant innovation of sequencing platforms which has made sequencing technologies become more superior and more powerful than ever before. Additionally, the efforts result in not only further cut down of the sequencing cost and increase in the sequencing speed, but also improvement in sequencing accuracy and extended sequencing application to studies at both DNA and RNA levels. Such knowledge will help the scientists interpret, at least partially, how plants can adapt to various environmental conditions, or how different cultivars can respond differently to the same stress. Another article by Ong et al. also laid emphasis on the importance of various high-throughput sequencing platforms, thanks to which a large number of genomic databases supplied with detailed annotation and useful bioinformatics tools have been established to assist geneticists. Readers can find in this review the summary of available plant-specific genomic databases up-to-date and popular web-based resources that are relevant for comparative genomics, plant evolution and phylogenomics studies. These, along with other approaches, such as quantitative trait locus and genome-wide association study, will lay foundation for prediction and identification of genes or alleles responsible for valuable agronomic traits, contributing to the enhancement of plant productivity by genetic engineering approach. In this thematic issue, specific examples for crop improvement are also demonstrated. The first showcase is given by Nongpiur et al. who provided evidence that synergistic employment of genomics approaches and high-throughput gene expression methods have aided in dissecting the salinity-responsive signaling pathway, identifying genes involved in the stress response and selecting candidate genes for further characterization aimed at generating new cultivars with better salinity stress tolerance. This paper is also a good reference source for readers who wish to get an overview about the general process from gene prediction to validation by experiments, including the details on techniques and approaches used. Another demonstration is provided by Khan et al. whose interest is enhancement of drought tolerance in crops. The focus of this article is to overview our current understanding of mechanisms regulating plants responses to drought. Evaluation of plant performance to drought and production of new elite varieties with better drought tolerance on the basis of using phenotyping and genomics-assisted breeding are also well discussed. In addition to the topics of environmental stress tolerance in plants, current knowledge on improving biotic stress tolerance is also summarized in our issue. Current picture on crosstalk of signaling mechanisms in rice between its immune system and symbiosis with microorganisms is presented by Akamatsu et al. Rice responses to bacteria and fungi via interactions between the plant pattern recognition receptors and the molecular microbe-associated molecular patterns are described in detail and suggested as targets for manipulation in order to increase disease resistance in crops. On the other hand, Bouain et al. are concerned about nutrient deficiency; specifically, how plant root system develops under growing conditions with inadequate phosphate. The authors overviewed our current understanding of the low phosphate-responsive mechanisms in Arabidopsis model plant, which was gained by using a combination of various advanced methods, including high-througput phenotyping, system biology analysis and ""omics"" technologies. Stress management in plants is proposed to be also achievable by regulating activities of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. As emphasized in the paper of Jha et al., the application of such channels is important in mediating cellular ion homeostasis and plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In summary, with recent progresses in biological and biotechnological areas, especially rapid development of advanced technologies in biological system modeling, functional genomics, computer-based analyzing tools, genetic engineering and molecular breeding, biological control and biotechnological applications in agriculture have brought about an extraordinary revolution and have been considered the most powerful approaches in maintaining or even increasing crop yield.

Thus, a new approach to comparative genomics, termed pan-genomics, was developed. In pan-genomics, various organisms of the same species or genus are compared.

The importance of the crop, as well as its long breeding cycle (10-12 years) has led to the sequencing of its genome in 2013 to pave the way for genomics-guided breeding. Nevertheless, the first set of gene predictions, although useful, had many fragmented genes. Classification and characterization of genes associated with traits of interest, such as those for fatty acid biosynthesis and disease resistance, were also limited. Lipid-, especially fatty acid (FA)-related genes are of particular interest for the oil palm as they specify oil yields and quality. This paper presents the characterization of the oil palm genome using different gene prediction methods and comparative genomics analysis, identification of FA biosynthesis and disease resistance genes, and the development of an annotation database and bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Using two independent gene-prediction pipelines, Fgenesh++ and Seqping, 26,059 oil palm genes with transcriptome and RefSeq support were identified from the oil palm genome. These coding regions of the genome have a characteristic broad distribution of GC(3) (fraction of cytosine and guanine in the third position of a codon) with over half the GC(3)-rich genes (GC(3) >/= 0.75286) being intronless. In comparison, only one-seventh of the oil palm genes identified are intronless. Using comparative genomics analysis, characterization of conserved domains and active sites, and expression analysis, 42 key genes involved in FA biosynthesis in oil palm were identified.

This dataset provides an excellent resource for comparative genomics analyses, which can be used to discover genetic elements, including noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Bioinformatics tools similar to those used to uncover novel ncRNAs in bacteria, likewise, should be useful for searching fungal genomic sequences, and the relative ease of genetic experiments with some model fungal species could facilitate experimental validation studies. RESULTS: We have adapted a bioinformatics pipeline for discovering bacterial ncRNAs to systematically analyze many fungal genomes. This comparative genomics pipeline integrates information on conserved RNA sequence and structural features with alternative splicing information to reveal fungal RNA motifs that are candidate regulatory domains, or that might have other possible functions. A total of 15 prominent classes of structured ncRNA candidates were identified, including variant HDV self-cleaving ribozyme representatives, atypical snoRNA candidates, and possible structured antisense RNA motifs. Candidate regulatory motifs were also found associated with genes for ribosomal proteins, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SDC), amidase, and HexA protein involved in Woronin body formation. We experimentally confirm that the variant HDV ribozymes undergo rapid self-cleavage, and we demonstrate that the SDC RNA motif reduces the expression of SAM decarboxylase by translational repression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that several other motifs discovered in this study are likely to be functional ncRNA elements. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening of fungal genomes using a computational discovery pipeline has revealed the existence of a variety of novel structured ncRNAs. Genome contexts and similarities to known ncRNA motifs provide strong evidence for the biological and biochemical functions of some newly found ncRNA motifs.

Comparative genomics using bioinformatics tools were applied to identify major virulence factors, biotype and antimicrobial resistance genes in three V. cholerae O1 strains (VC-1, 2 and 3) isolated from two case patients. A phylogenetic SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-based analysis was conducted to infer the relatedness to V. cholerae O1 strains isolated elsewhere. The V. cholerae strains were the El Tor variant carrying ctxB1 (standard classical genotype). SNP-based global phylogeny revealed that the three isolates were strictly clonal and the closest neighbouring genomes were epidemic clones of V. cholerae O1 isolated in 2010 from cholera patients in Pakistan.

This motivated us to develop the M1CR0B1AL1Z3R web server, a 'one-stop shop' for conducting microbial genomics data analyses via a simple graphical user interface. Some of the features implemented in M1CR0B1AL1Z3R are: (i) extracting putative open reading frames and comparative genomics analysis of gene content; (ii) extracting orthologous sets and analyzing their size distribution; (iii) analyzing gene presence-absence patterns; (iv) reconstructing a phylogenetic tree based on the extracted orthologous set; (v) inferring GC-content variation among lineages. M1CR0B1AL1Z3R facilitates the mining and analysis of dozens of bacterial genomes using advanced techniques, with the click of a button.

Examples in Prostate Cancer.,Cancer genomics & proteomics,"The identification of cancer biomarkers that will predict susceptibility to disease and subsequent clinical outcome are key components of future genomics-based tailored medical care. Animal models of disease provide a rich resource for the identification of potential cancer biomarkers. Animal models of prostate cancer in particular offer the potential to identify cancer genes associated with dietary and environmental factors. The key issue is the timely and efficient identification of candidate genes that are likely to impact on human prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate comparative genomics-based methods for the identification of candidate genes in animal models that are associated with human chromosomal regions implicated in prostate cancer. Using publicly available bioinformatics tools, comparisons can be made between cancer-specific datasets, genomic sequencing data and cross-species comparative maps to identify potential cancer biomarkers. This process is demonstrated by using rat models of prostate cancer to identify candidate human prostate cancer genes. Genes identified through these techniques can be screened as biomarkers for response to chemopreventive agents, as well as being used in transgenic or knockout mice to engineer better animal models of human prostate cancer. The bioinformatics techniques outlined here can be used to leverage genomic data from any animal cancer model for use in the study and treatment of human cancer.",2005 May-Jun
"""Bioinformatics Tools"" AND ""Comparative genomics""",31747873,Comparison of different annotation tools for characterization of the complete chloroplast genome of Corylus avellana cv Tombul.,BMC genomics,"BACKGROUND: Several bioinformatics tools have been designed for assembly and annotation of chloroplast (cp) genomes, making it difficult to decide which is most useful and applicable to a specific case. The increasing number of plant genomes provide an opportunity to accurately obtain cp genomes from whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences. Due to the limited genetic information available for European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) and as part of a genome sequencing project, we analyzed the complete chloroplast genome of the cultivar 'Tombul' with multiple annotation tools. RESULTS: Three different annotation strategies were tested, and the complete cp genome of C. avellana cv Tombul was constructed, which was 161,667 bp in length, and had a typical quadripartite structure. A large single copy (LSC) region of 90,198 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,733 bp were separated by a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,368 bp. In total, 125 predicted functional genes were annotated, including 76 protein-coding, 25 tRNA, and 4 rRNA unique genes. Comparative genomics indicated that the cp genome sequences were relatively highly conserved in species belonging to the same order. However, there were still some variations, especially in intergenic regions, that could be used as molecular markers for analyses of phylogeny and plant identification. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that there were 83 SSRs in the cp genome of cv Tombul. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that C. avellana cv Tombul had a close affinity to the sister group of C. fargesii and C. chinensis, and then a closer evolutionary relationship with Betulaceae family than other species of Fagales. CONCLUSION: In this study, the complete cp genome of Corylus avellana cv Tombul, the most widely cultivated variety in Turkey, was obtained and annotated, and additionally phylogenetic relationships were predicted among Fagales species. Our results suggest a very accurate assembly of chloroplast genome from next generation whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences. Enhancement of taxon sampling in Corylus species provide genomic insights into phylogenetic analyses. The nucleotide sequences of cv Tombul cp genomes can provide comprehensive genetic insight into the evolution of genus Corylus.",2019 Nov 20

The pathogenicity of this white-rot fungus has been associated with cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) released during saprophytic and necrotrophic stage of infection of the oil palm host. However, there is a lack of information available on the essentiality of CWDEs in wood-decaying process and pathogenesis of this oil palm pathogen especially at molecular and genome levels. METHODS: In this study, comparative genome analysis was carried out using the G. boninense NJ3 genome to identify and characterize carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZymes) including CWDE in the fungal genome. Augustus pipeline was employed for gene identification in G. boninense NJ3 and the produced protein sequences were analyzed via dbCAN pipeline and PhiBase 4.5 database annotation for CAZymes and plant-host interaction (PHI) gene analysis, respectively. Comparison of CAZymes from G. boninense NJ3 was made against G. lucidum, a well-studied model Ganoderma sp. and five selected pathogenic fungi for CAZymes characterization. Functional annotation of PHI genes was carried out using Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO) and was used for selecting candidate PHI genes related to cell wall degradation of G. boninense NJ3. RESULTS: G. boninense was enriched with CAZymes and CWDEs in a similar fashion to G. lucidum that corroborate with the lignocellulolytic abilities of both closely-related fungal strains. The role of polysaccharide and cell wall degrading enzymes in the hemibiotrophic mode of infection of G. boninense was investigated by analyzing the fungal CAZymes with necrotrophic Armillaria solidipes, A. mellea, biotrophic Ustilago maydis, Melampsora larici-populina and hemibiotrophic Moniliophthora perniciosa. Profiles of the selected pathogenic fungi demonstrated that necrotizing pathogens including G. boninense NJ3 exhibited an extensive set of CAZymes as compared to the more CAZymes-limited biotrophic pathogens. Following PHI analysis, several candidate genes including polygalacturonase, endo beta-1,3-xylanase, beta-glucanase and laccase were identified as potential CWDEs that contribute to the plant host interaction and pathogenesis. DISCUSSION: This study employed bioinformatics tools for providing a greater understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the production of CAZymes in G. boninense NJ3. Identification and profiling of the fungal polysaccharide- and lignocellulosic-degrading enzymes would further facilitate in elucidating the infection mechanisms through the production of CWDEs by G. boninense. Identification of CAZymes and CWDE-related PHI genes in G. boninense would serve as the basis for functional studies of genes associated with the fungal virulence and pathogenicity using systems biology and genetic engineering approaches.",2019

One of these successful means might be the effective and efficient way of communication. To support this notion, cervids are well equipped with a variety of skin glands that distribute in different body regions. However, studies relevant to adaptive evolution in cervids, particularly on olfactory reception at the molecular level, have thus far not been reported. OBJECTIVE: To provide valuable insights into molecular evidence for the adaptive evolution of olfactory-related gene in cervids. METHODS: Based on recently sequenced genomes of cervids and closely-related-species, we performed comparative genomic analysis at genome level using bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Tree topology strongly supported that Bovidae was the sister group of Moschidae and both formed a branch that was then clustered with Cervidae. Expansion of heavy chain genes of the dynein family and 51 rapidly evolving genes could be associated with adaptation of cilia that serve as sensory organelles and act as cellular antennae. Based on the branch-site model test along the deer branch spanning 7-21 mammalian species, 14 deer olfactory receptor genes were found to be undergoing positive selection pressure and 89 positive selection sites (probability > 60%) had amino acid substitutions unique to deer.

The genomes, used in the current study, were available and downloaded from the GenBank which were primarily related with microorganisms isolated from dairy products and secondarily from other foodstuffs. To study the genetic diversity of the microorganism, various bioinformatics tools were employed such as average nucleotide identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization, phylogenetic analysis, clusters of orthologous groups analysis, KEGG orthology analysis and pan-genomic analysis. The results showed that Lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains cannot be sufficiently separated into phylogenetic lineages based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences and core genome-based phylogenetic analysis was more appropriate. Pan-genomic analysis of the strains indicated that the core, accessory and unique genome comprised of 1036, 3146 and 1296 genes, respectively. Considering the results of pan-genomic and KEGG orthology analyses, the metabolic network of Lc. lactis subsp. lactis was rebuild regarding its carbohydrates' metabolic capabilities. Based on the metatranscriptomic data during the ripening of the Swiss-type Maasdam cheese at 20  degrees C and 5  degrees C, it was shown that the microorganism performed mixed acid fermentation producing lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol and 2,3-butanediol. Mixed acid fermentation was more pronounced at higher ripening temperatures. At lower ripening temperatures, the genes involved in mixed acid fermentation were repressed while lactate production remained unaffected resembling to a homolactic fermentation.

We aim to investigate the phenotypic and genomic profiles of pregnancy-associated L. monocytogenes isolates and their association with isolates recovered from human and non-human in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we conducted a 3-year surveillance of listeriosis in a women's hospital in Zhejiang province, using whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2018, we identified 13 clinical L. monocytogenes isolates. Among these pregnancy-associated isolates, we found seven sequence types (STs), with the prevalent STs of ST87 and ST7. Serotyping divided the strains into four serotypes, including serotype 1/2a, 1/2b, 3a, and 4b. Antimicrobial resistance testing showed that all the isolates were susceptible to 10 antibiotics. Comparative genomics analysis clearly classified our genome collection into four distinct evolutionary lineages with most isolates grouping into lineages I and II. Interestingly, we found three pairs of isolates with high identity, although no evident epidemiological association was observed. CONCLUSION: This study reports for the first time the surveillance of pregnancy-associated listeriosis in Zhejiang province, China, which indicates that the infection rate is low in this region. Our findings provide insight into the evolution and genetic diversity of pregnancy-associated L. monocytogenes from Zhejiang province.

The BGC for dnacin B1 contains 41 ORFs and spans a 66.9 kb DNA region in strain DSM 44131(T). Its involvement in dnacin B1 biosynthesis was identified through the deletion of a 9.7 kb region. Based on the functional gene analysis, we proposed the biosynthetic pathway for dnacin B1. Moreover, p-amino-phenylalanine (PAPA) unit was found to be the dnacin B1 precursor for the quinone moiety formation, and this was confirmed by heterologous expression of dinV, dinE and dinF in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, nine potential PAPA aminotransferases (APAT) from the genome of strain DSM 44131(T) were explored and expressed. Biochemical evaluation of their amino group transformation ability was carried out with p-amino-phenylpyruvic acid (PAPP) or PAPA as the substrate for the final product formation.

Therefore, genetic testing and molecular pathogenicity analysis are essential for precise diagnosis and new targets for preventive pharmacotherapy.

In this study, we report the identification of a novel variant in the CLCN7 gene in a patient diagnosed with osteopetrosis and provide evidence for its significance (likely deleterious) based on extensive comparative genomics, protein sequence and structure analysis. A set of automated bioinformatics tools used to predict consequences of this variant identified it as deleterious or pathogenic. Structure analysis revealed that the variant is located at the same ""hot spot"" as the most common CLCN7 mutations causing osteopetrosis. Deep phylogenetic reconstruction showed that not only Leu614Arg, but any non-aliphatic substitutions in this position are evolutionarily intolerant, further supporting the deleterious nature of the variant.

Although hundreds of complete genomes of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates have been sequenced, only a few complete genomes of mucoid strains are available, limiting a comprehensive understanding of this important group of opportunistic pathogens. Herein, the complete genome of a clinically isolated mucoid strain P. aeruginosa JNQH-PA57 was sequenced and assembled using Illumina and Oxford nanopore sequencing technologies. Genomic features, phylogenetic relationships, and comparative genomics of this pathogen were comprehensively analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. A series of phenotypic and molecular-genetic tests were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in this strain. RESULTS: Several genomic features of MDR P. aeruginosa JNQH-PA57 were identified based on the whole-genome sequencing. We found that the accessory genome of JNQH-PA57 including several prophages, genomic islands, as well as a PAPI-1 family integrative and conjugative element (ICE), mainly contributed to the larger genome of this strain (6,747,067 bp) compared to other popular P. aeruginosa strains (with an average genome size of 6,445,223 bp) listed in Pseudomonas Genome Database. Colony morphology analysis and biofilm crystal staining assay respectively demonstrated an enhanced alginate production and a thicker biofilm formation capability of JNQH-PA57. A deleted mutation at nt 424 presented in mucA gene, resulted in the upregulated expression of a sigma-factor AlgU and a GDP mannose dehydrogenase AlgD, which might explain the mucoid phenotype of this strain. As for the carbapenem resistance mechanisms, our results revealed that the interplay between impaired OprD porin, chromosomal beta-lactamase OXA-488 expression, MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM efflux pumps overexpression, synergistically with the alginates-overproducing protective biofilm, conferred the high carbapenem resistance to P. aeruginosa JNQH-PA57. CONCLUSION: Based on the genome analysis, we could demonstrate that the upregulated expression of algU and algD, which due to the truncation variant of MucA, might account for the mucoid phenotype of JNQH-PA57.

Its high genetic diversity among strains is caused by a high mutation rate, observing virulence factors (VFs) variations in different geographic lineages. This study aimed to postulate the genetic variability associated with virulence factors present in the Helicobacter pylori strains, to identify the relationship of these genes with their phylogeographic origin. METHODS: The complete genomes of 135 strains available in NCBI, from different population origins, were analyzed using bioinformatics tools, identifying a high rate; as well as reorganization events in 87 virulence factor genes, divided into seven functional groups, to determine changes in position, number of copies, nucleotide identity and size, contrasting them with their geographical lineage and pathogenic phenotype. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analyses show a high rate of gene annotation errors in VF. Analysis of genetic variability of VFs shown that there is not a direct relationship between the reorganization and geographic lineage. However, regarding the pathogenic phenotype demonstrated in the analysis of many copies, size, and similarity when dividing the strains that possess and not the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), having a higher risk of developing gastritis and peptic ulcer was evidenced. Our data has shown that the analysis of the overall genetic variability of all VFs present in each strain of H. pylori is key information in understanding its pathogenic behavior.",2021

When combined with the advances in network inference tools, this can lead to powerful methodologies for mining genomics data, allowing development of pipelines that stretch from sequence reads mapping to network inference. However, integrating various methods and tools available over different platforms requires a programmatic framework to fully exploit their analytic capabilities. Integrating multiple genomic analysis tools faces challenges from standardization of input and output formats, normalization of results for performing comparative analyses, to developing intuitive and easy to control scripts and interfaces for the genomic analysis pipeline. RESULTS: We describe here NetSeekR, a network analysis R package that includes the capacity to analyze time series of RNA-Seq data, to perform correlation and regulatory network inferences and to use network analysis methods to summarize the results of a comparative genomics study. The software pipeline includes alignment of reads, differential gene expression analysis, correlation network analysis, regulatory network analysis, gene ontology enrichment analysis and network visualization of differentially expressed genes. The implementation provides support for multiple RNA-Seq read mapping methods and allows comparative analysis of the results obtained by different bioinformatics methods. CONCLUSION: Our methodology increases the level of integration of genomics data analysis tools to network inference, facilitating hypothesis building, functional analysis and genomics discovery from large scale NGS data.

Due to its recent discovery, our knowledge of its biology, including the factors underlying sustained, fast growth, is limited. Furthermore, tools specific for genetic manipulation of PCC 11901 are not established. Here, we demonstrate that PCC 11901 shows faster growth than other model cyanobacteria, including the fast-growing species Synechococcuselongatus UTEX 2973, under optimal growth conditions for UTEX 2973. Comparative genomics between PCC 11901 and Synechocystis sp.

The data provided in this article includes the sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from three culture-negative brain abscess samples suspected to have poly-microbial aetiology based on Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from brain abscess samples, and targeted-metagenomics sequencing was done by amplifying the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA followed by a nested PCR for V3-V4 regions using universal and specific primers. The barcoded amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq V2 instrument to generate 0.5M, 250bp paired-end reads/sample. The total sequencing reads were 455966, 345746, and 438658 for samples P32, P49, and P8, respectively.

This study aimed to understand the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 through the comparative genomic analysis with the closest one among the seven species of coronavirus that infect humans. The genomes of coronavirus species that infect humans were retrieved from NCBI, and then subjected to comparative genomic analysis using different bioinformatics tools. The study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is the most similar to SARS-CoV among the coronavirus species. The core genes were shared by the two genomes, but there were some genes, found in one of them but not in both, such as ORF8, which is found in SARS-CoV-2. The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 could be considered as a good therapeutic target for stopping viral transmission, as it was predicted to be a transmembrane protein, which is responsible for interspecies transmission. This is supported by the molecular interaction of ORF8 with both the ORF7 protein, which contains a transmembrane domain that is essential to retaining the protein in the Golgi compartment, and the S protein, which facilitates the entry of the coronavirus into host cells. ORF1ab, ORF1a, ORF8, and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 could be immunogenic and capable of evoking an immune response, which means that these four proteins could be considered a potential vaccine source.

Genome based safety assessment of probiotics has gained popularity due its cost efficiency and speed, and even became a part of national regulation on foods containing probiotics in Indonesia. However, reliability of the safety assessment based only on a full genome sequence is not clear. Here, for the first time, we sequenced, assembled, and analysed the genome of the probiotic strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IS-10506, that was isolated from dadih, a traditional fermented buffalo milk. The strain has already been used as a probiotic for more than a decade, and in several clinical trials proven to be completely safe. METHODS: The genome of the probiotic strain L. plantarum IS-10506 was sequenced using Nanopore sequencing technology, assembled, annotated and screened for potential harmful (PH) and beneficial genomic features. The presence of the PH features was assessed from general annotation, as well as with the use of specialised tools. In addition, PH regions in the genome were compared to all other probiotic and non-probiotic L. plantarum strains available in the NCBI RefSeq database. RESULTS: For the first time, a high-quality complete genome of L. plantarum IS-10506 was obtained, and an extensive search for PH and a beneficial signature was performed. We discovered a number of PH features within the genome of L. plantarum IS-10506 based on the general annotation, including various antibiotic resistant genes (AMR); however, with a few exceptions, bioinformatics tools specifically developed for AMR detection did not confirm their presence. We further demonstrated the presence of the detected PH genes across multiple L. plantarum strains, including probiotics, and overall high genetic similarities between strains. CONCLUSION: The genome of L. plantarum IS-10506 is predicted to have several PH features. However, the strain has been utilized as a probiotic for over a decade in several clinical trials without any adverse effects, even in immunocompromised children with HIV infection and undernourished children. This implies the presence of PH feature signatures within the probiotic genome does not necessarily indicate their manifestation during administration. Importantly, specialized tools for the search of PH features were found more robust and should be preferred over manual searches in a general annotation.",2023 Sep 4

DeepVariant (DV) excels without joint genotyping while offering fewer implementation barriers. However, the growing appeal of a ""universal"" algorithm has magnified the unknown impacts when used with non-human genomes. Here, we use bovine genomes to assess the limits of human-genome-trained models in other species. We introduce the first multi-species DV model that achieves a lower Mendelian Inheritance Error (MIE) rate during single-sample genotyping. Our novel approach, TrioTrain, automates extending DV for species without Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) resources and uses region shuffling to mitigate barriers for SLURM-based clusters. To offset imperfect truth labels for animal genomes, we remove Mendelian discordant variants before training, where models are tuned to genotype the offspring correctly. With TrioTrain, we use cattle, yak, and bison trios to build 30 model iterations across five phases. We observe remarkable performance across phases when testing the GIAB human trios with a mean SNP F1 score >0.990. In HG002, our phase 4 bovine model identifies more variants at a lower MIE rate than DeepTrio. In bovine F1-hybrid genomes, our model substantially reduces inheritance errors with a mean MIE rate of 0.03 percent. Although constrained by imperfect labels, we find that multi-species, trio-based training produces a robust variant calling model.
