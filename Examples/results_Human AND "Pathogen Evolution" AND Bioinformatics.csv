Population studies, which combine these data with epidemiological, phylogenetic, and evolutionary concepts, provide insights into the behaviour of pathogens that are unavailable from other approaches as they address questions of relevance to pathogenesis from the perspective of the infectious organism rather from that of the host. Hypothesis-driven analyses applied to these data permit the determination of microbial population diversity and structure, the identification of the mechanisms of genetic change in bacterial populations, and the generation of models of pathogen evolution. The nucleotide sequence-based population studies performed to date demonstrate a spectrum of nucleotide sequence diversity, population structure, and evolutionary mechanisms among pathogenic bacteria. The rapid development of nucleotide sequence determination and analysis techniques provides the tools necessary for the prosecution of population studies on an increasing number of bacterial pathogens.",2000 May

Examples of phage participation in this process proved to a different extent are described. Emphasis is placed on the original work carried out in Russia and focused on bacteriophages (temperate transposable phages and giant virulent phi KZ-like phages) of conditional pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Consideration is given to the possible lines of further research of the role of bacteriophages in the infection process and, in particular, the role of virulent phages, whose products are similar to those of pathogenic bacteria, in modification of clinical signs of infectious diseases and in evolution. An attempt is made to predict the possible direction of pathogen evolution associated with development of new treatment strategies and generation of new specific niches.",2003 May

It is believed that H. pylori infects over 50% of the worlds' population. However, only a small subset of infected people experience H. pylori-associated illnesses. Associations with disease-specific factors remain enigmatic. The contribution of comparative genomics to our understanding of the genome organisation and diversity of H. pylori is exemplified herein. The discovery of the cag pathogenicity island has revolutionised our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcers. Another type IV secretion system, the comB gene cluster, provides a novel transformation system. Identification of this cluster has boosted our perception of horizontal gene transfer and gene mosaicism in H. pylori as a result of natural competence. Recent discovery of a third type IV secretion system called tfs3 encoding cluster in the so called plasticity zone of the H. pylori has gained significant attention, although its role is not clear. Study of the evolution of polymorphisms and sequence variation in H. pylori populations on a global basis is contributing to understanding of the history of human population migration and co-evolution of this pathogen with its human host. Possible symbiotic relationships were debated since the discovery of this pathogen. The debate has been further intensified as recent studies have posed the intriguing possibility that H. pylori infection may be advantageous in some humans. This analogy is based on increased incidence of diseases like gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus following H. pylori eradication in some patients.",2004 Jun
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",15916705,Comparative genomics of Helicobacter pylori isolates recovered from ulcer disease patients in England.,BMC microbiology,"BACKGROUND: Genomic diversity of H. pylori from many different human populations is largely unknown. We compared genomes of 65 H. pylori strains from Nottingham, England. Molecular analysis was carried out to identify rearrangements within and outside the cag-pathogenicity-island (cag PAI) and DNA sequence divergence in candidate genes. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on various high-resolution genotyping techniques. RESULTS: Analyses of virulence genes (cagT, cagE, cagA, vacA, iceA, oipA and babB) revealed that H. pylori strains from England are genetically distinct from strains obtained from other countries. The toxigenic vacA s1m1 genotype was found to be less common and the plasticity region cluster was found to be disrupted in all the isolates. English isolates showed a predominance of iceA1 alleles and a functional proinflammatory oipA gene. The English H. pylori gene pool revealed several Asian/oriental features. This included the predominance of cagA - glr (cagA right junction) motif types III and II (up to 42%), presence of vacA m1c alleles and phylogenetic affinity towards East Asian / Amerindian gene pools based on fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) analysis and glmM sequence analysis. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results demonstrated genetic affinities of H. pylori in England with both European and the Asian gene pools and some distinctive genetic features of virulence genes that may have evolved in this important European population.",2005 May 25

Genomic diversity of the organism has enabled new insights into its population biology through comparative genomics. genoBASE pylori is an online databank of several virulence-linked and phylogenetic markers of H. pylori strains obtained from different human populations. This knowledgebase is built upon a relational database management system which is connected to visualize the presence of known, pathogenicity markers such as the co-ordinates within the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), the cagA gene and motifs surrounding it, the vacA allotypes and the oipA gene frame status, together with genotypic details in the form of DNA profiling traces and candidate gene sequences for individual strains. This flexible search tool allows inter-laboratory comparison of DNA fingerprinting data in the form of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) and repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) signature profiles. Besides this, the database also displays diversity of strains based on nucleotide sequences of several house keeping genes and two membrane proteins. Being the first of its kind, genoBASE pylori is expected to be a helpful online tool in strengthening the concept of 'geographic genomics' and will be useful to molecular epidemiologists, clinical laboratory scientists and those interested in diagnostic development for H. pylori.

This will eventually lead to a better understanding of pathogen evolution, more accurate genotyping, and advancements in vaccine development. In this paper, we introduce RB-Finder, a fast and accurate distance-based window method to detect recombination in a multiple sequence alignment. Our method introduces a more informative distance measure and a novel weighting strategy to reduce the window size sensitivity problem and hence improve the accuracy of breakpoint detection. Furthermore, our method is faster than existing phylogeny-based methods since we do not need to construct and compare complex phylogenetic trees. When compared with the current best method Pruned-PDM, our method is a few hundred times more efficient. Experimental evaluation of RB-Finder using synthetic and biological datasets showed that our method is more accurate than existing phylogeny-based methods. We also show how our method has potential use in other related applications such as genotyping.",2008 Sep

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",21352760,Understanding the dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens through modeling the tempo of antigenic change: influenza as a case study.,Epidemics,"Rapidly evolving pathogens present a major conceptual and mathematical challenge to our understanding of disease dynamics. For these pathogens, the simulation of disease dynamics requires the use of computational models that incorporate pathogen evolution. Currently, these models are limited by two factors. First, their computational complexity hinders their numerical analysis and the ease with which parameters can be statistically estimated. Second, their formulations are frequently not sufficiently general to allow for alternative immunological hypotheses to be considered. Here, we introduce a new modeling framework for rapidly evolving pathogens that lessens both of these limitations. At its core, the proposed framework differs from previous multi-strain models by modeling the tempo of antigenic change instead of the pathogen's genetic change. This shift in focus results in a new model of reduced computational complexity that can accommodate different immunological hypotheses. We demonstrate the utility of this antigenic tempo model in an application to influenza. We show that, under different parameterizations, the model can reproduce the qualitative findings of a diverse set of previously published flu models, despite being less computationally intensive. These advantages of the antigenic tempo model make it a useful alternative to address several outstanding questions for rapidly evolving pathogens.",2009 Jun
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",22216135,Differential trends in the codon usage patterns in HIV-1 genes.,PloS one,"Host-pathogen interactions underlie one of the most complex evolutionary phenomena resulting in continual adaptive genetic changes, where pathogens exploit the host's molecular resources for growth and survival, while hosts try to eliminate the pathogen. Deciphering the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions is useful in understanding the factors governing pathogen evolution and disease propagation. In host-pathogen context, a balance between mutation, selection, and genetic drift is known to maintain codon bias in both organisms. Studies revealing determinants of the bias and its dynamics are central to the understanding of host-pathogen evolution. We considered the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type 1 and its human host to search for evolutionary signatures in the viral genome. Positive selection is known to dominate intra-host evolution of HIV-1, whereas high genetic variability underlies the belief that neutral processes drive inter-host differences. In this study, we analyze the codon usage patterns of HIV-1 genomes across all subtypes and clades sequenced over a period of 23 years. We show presence of unique temporal correlations in the codon bias of three HIV-1 genes illustrating differential adaptation of the HIV-1 genes towards the host preferred codons. Our results point towards gene-specific translational selection to be an important force driving the evolution of HIV-1 at the population level.",2011
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",22590641,"Edwardsiella comparative phylogenomics reveal the new intra/inter-species taxonomic relationships, virulence evolution and niche adaptation mechanisms.",PloS one,"Edwardsiella bacteria are leading fish pathogens causing huge losses to aquaculture industries worldwide. E. tarda is a broad-host range pathogen that infects more than 20 species of fish and other animals including humans while E. ictaluri is host-adapted to channel catfish causing enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC). Thus, these two species consist of a useful comparative system for studying the intricacies of pathogen evolution. Here we present for the first time the phylogenomic comparisons of 8 genomes of E. tarda and E. ictaluri isolates. Genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that E. tarda could be separate into two kinds of genotypes (genotype I, EdwGI and genotype II, EdwGII) based on the sequence similarity. E. tarda strains of EdwGI were clustered together with the E. ictaluri lineage and showed low sequence conservation to E. tarda strains of EdwGII. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of 48 distinct Edwardsiella strains also supports the new taxonomic relationship of the lineages. We identified the type III and VI secretion systems (T3SS and T6SS) as well as iron scavenging related genes that fulfilled the criteria of a key evolutionary factor likely facilitating the virulence evolution and adaptation to a broad range of hosts in EdwGI E. tarda. The surface structure-related genes may underlie the adaptive evolution of E. ictaluri in the host specification processes. Virulence and competition assays of the null mutants of the representative genes experimentally confirmed their contributive roles in the evolution/niche adaptive processes. We also reconstructed the hypothetical evolutionary pathway to highlight the virulence evolution and niche adaptation mechanisms of Edwardsiella. This study may facilitate the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for this under-studied pathogen.",2012

From a pre-intervention high of 384 per 100,000 population in 2006, incidence dropped by 50% in 2008; a reduction that has been sustained since. This article illustrates many aspects of the successful use of molecular-based surveillance, including the distinction between control-focused and strategy-focused surveillance and advances in source attribution. We discuss how microbial genetic data can enhance the understanding of epidemiological explanatory and response variables and thereby enrich the epidemiological analysis. Sequence data can be fitted to evolutionary and epidemiological models to gain new insights into pathogen evolution, the nature of associations between strains of pathogens and host species, and aspects of between-host transmission. With the advent of newer sequencing technologies and the availability of rapid, high-coverage genome sequence data, such techniques may be extended and refined within the emerging discipline of genomic epidemiology. The aim of this article is to summarise the experience gained in New Zealand with molecular-based surveillance of campylobacteriosis and to discuss how this experience could be used to further advance the use of molecular tools in surveillance.",2013 Jan 17
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",23736103,"When outgroups fail; phylogenomics of rooting the emerging pathogen, Coxiella burnetii.",Systematic biology,"Rooting phylogenies is critical for understanding evolution, yet the importance, intricacies and difficulties of rooting are often overlooked. For rooting, polymorphic characters among the group of interest (ingroup) must be compared to those of a relative (outgroup) that diverged before the last common ancestor (LCA) of the ingroup. Problems arise if an outgroup does not exist, is unknown, or is so distant that few characters are shared, in which case duplicated genes originating before the LCA can be used as proxy outgroups to root diverse phylogenies. Here, we describe a genome-wide expansion of this technique that can be used to solve problems at the other end of the evolutionary scale: where ingroup individuals are all very closely related to each other, but the next closest relative is very distant. We used shared orthologous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 whole genome sequences of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever in humans, to create a robust, but unrooted phylogeny. To maximize the number of characters informative about the rooting, we searched entire genomes for polymorphic duplicated regions where orthologs of each paralog could be identified so that the paralogs could be used to root the tree. Recent radiations, such as those of emerging pathogens, often pose rooting challenges due to a lack of ingroup variation and large genomic differences with known outgroups. Using a phylogenomic approach, we created a robust, rooted phylogeny for C. burnetii.

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",24681054,"PAPNC, a novel method to calculate nucleotide diversity from large scale next generation sequencing data.",Journal of virological methods,"Estimating viral diversity in infected patients can provide insight into pathogen evolution and emergence of drug resistance. With the widespread adoption of deep sequencing, it is important to develop tools to accurately calculate population diversity from very large datasets. Current methods for estimating diversity that are based on multiple alignments are not practical to apply to such data. In this study, the authors report a novel method (Pairwise Alignment Positional Nucleotide Counting, PAPNC) for estimating population diversity from 454 sequence data. The diversity measurements determined using this method were comparable to those calculated by average pairwise difference (APD) of multiply aligned sequences using MEGA5. Diversities were estimated for 9 patient plasma HIV samples sequenced with Titanium 454 technology and by single-genome sequencing (SGS). Diversities calculated from deep sequencing using PAPNC ranged from 0.002 to 0.021 while APD measurements calculated from SGS data ranged proximately from 0.001 to 0.018, with the difference being attributable to PCR error (contributing background diversity of 0.0016 in a control sample). Comparison of APDs estimated from 100 sets of sequences drawn at random from 454 generated data and from corresponding SGS data showed very close correlation between the two methods with R(2) of 0.96, and differing on average by about 1% (after correction for PCR error). The authors have developed a novel method that is good for calculating genetic diversities for large scale datasets from next generation sequencing. It can be implemented easily as a function in available variation calling programs like SAMtools or haplotype reconstruction software for nucleotide genetic diversity calculation. A Perl script implementing this method is available upon request.",2014 Jul
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",24760760,Excessive production and extreme editing of human metapneumovirus defective interfering RNA is associated with type I IFN induction.,The Journal of general virology,"Type I IFN production is one of the hallmarks of host innate immune responses upon virus infection. Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70% of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.",2014 Aug
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",25227464,Environmental heterogeneity drives within-host diversification and evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,mBio,"Microbial population polymorphisms are commonly observed in natural environments, including long-term infected hosts. However, the underlying processes promoting and stabilizing diversity are difficult to unravel and are not well understood. Here, we use chronic infection of cystic fibrosis airways by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a system for investigating bacterial diversification processes during the course of infection. We analyze clonal bacterial isolates sampled during a 32-year period and map temporal and spatial variations in population diversity to different infection sites within the infected host. We show that the ancestral infecting strain diverged into distinct sublineages, each with their own functional and genomic signatures and rates of adaptation, immediately after initial colonization. The sublineages coexisted in the host for decades, suggesting rapid evolution of stable population polymorphisms. Critically, the observed generation and maintenance of population diversity was the result of partitioning of the sublineages into physically separated niches in the CF airway. The results reveal a complex within-host population structure not previously realized and provide evidence that the heterogeneity of the highly structured and complex host environment promotes the evolution and long-term stability of pathogen population diversity during infection. IMPORTANCE: Within-host pathogen evolution and diversification during the course of chronic infections is of importance in relation to therapeutic intervention strategies, yet our understanding of these processes is limited. Here, we investigate intraclonal population diversity in P. aeruginosa during chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis patients. We show the evolution of a diverse population structure immediately after initial colonization, with divergence into multiple distinct sublineages that coexisted for decades and occupied distinct niches. Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity in CF airways plays a major role in relation to the generation and maintenance of population diversity and emphasize that a single isolate in sputum may not represent the entire pathogen population in the infected individual. A more complete understanding of the evolution of distinct clonal variants and their distribution in different niches could have positive implications for efficient therapy.",2014 Sep 16
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",25532802,Ancient pathogen genomics: insights into timing and adaptation.,Journal of human evolution,"Disease is a major cause of natural selection affecting human evolution, whether through a sudden pandemic or persistent morbidity and mortality. Recent contributions in the field of ancient pathogen genomics have advanced our understanding of the antiquity and nature of human-pathogen interactions through time. Technical advancements have facilitated the recovery, enrichment, and high-throughput sequencing of pathogen and parasite DNA from archived and archaeological remains. These time-stamped genomes are crucial for calibrating molecular clocks to infer the timing of evolutionary events, while providing finer-grain resolution to phylogenetic reconstructions and complex biogeographical patterns. Additionally, genome scale data allow better identification of substitutions linked to adaptations of the pathogen to their human hosts.

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",25573168,Viral diversity and clonal evolution from unphased genomic data.,BMC genomics,"BACKGROUND: Clonal expansion is a process in which a single organism reproduces asexually, giving rise to a diversifying population. It is pervasive in nature, from within-host pathogen evolution to emergent infectious disease outbreaks. Standard phylogenetic tools rely on full-length genomes of individual pathogens or population consensus sequences (phased genotypes). METHODS: We introduce two measures of diversity to study the evolution of clonal populations using unphased genomic data, which eliminate the need to construct full-length genomes. Our method follows a maximum likelihood approach to estimate evolutionary rates and times to the most recent common ancestor, based on a relaxed molecular clock model; independent of a growth model. Deviations from neutral evolution indicate the presence of selection and bottleneck events. RESULTS: We evaluated our methods in silico and then compared it against existing approaches with the well-characterized 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. We then applied our method to high-throughput genomic data from marburgvirus-infected non-human primates and inferred the time of infection and the intra-host evolutionary rate, and identified purifying selection in viral populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our method has the power to make use of minor variants present in less than 1% of the population and capture genomic diversification within days of infection, making it an ideal tool for the study of acute RNA viral infection dynamics.",2014

This review discusses new insights into disease spread and transmission that have come from the use of WGS, particularly when combined with genomic scale phylogenetic analyses. These include elucidation of the mechanisms of cross species transmission, the potential modes of pathogen transmission, and which people in the population contribute most to transmission. Particular attention is paid to the ability of WGS to resolve individual patient to patient transmission events. Importantly, WGS data seem to be sufficiently discriminatory to target cases linked to community or hospital contacts and hence prevent further spread, and to investigate genetically related cases without a clear epidemiological link. Approaches to combine evidence from epidemiological with genomic sequencing observations are summarised. Ongoing genomic surveillance can identify determinants of transmission, monitor pathogen evolution and adaptation, ensure the accurate and timely diagnosis of infections with epidemic potential, and refine strategies for their control.",2015 May 11
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",26017358,MANTIS: an R package that simulates multilocus models of pathogen evolution.,BMC bioinformatics,"BACKGROUND: In host-pathogen systems the development of immunity by the host places pressure on pathogens, by setting up competition between genetic variants due to the establishment of cross-protective responses. These pressures can lead to pathogen-specific, ubiquitous dynamic behaviours. Understanding the evolutionary forces that shape these patterns is one of the key goals of computationally simulated epidemiological models. Despite the contribution of such research methods in recent years to our current understanding of pathogen evolution, the availability of free software tools for the general public remains scarce. RESULTS: We developed the Multilocus ANTIgenic Simulator (MANTIS) software package for the R statistical environment. MANTIS can simulate and analyse epidemiological time-series generated under the biological assumptions of the strain theory of host-pathogen systems by Gupta et al. CONCLUSIONS: MANTIS wraps a C/C++ ordinary-differential equations system and Runge-Kutta solver into a set of user-friendly R functions. These include routines to numerically simulate the system and others to analyse, visualize and export results. For this, the package offers its own set of time-series plotting and exportation functions. MANTIS's main goal is to serve as a free, ready-to-use academic software tool. Its open source nature further provides an opportunity for users with advanced programming skills to expand its capabilities.

As such, simulation of pathogen dynamics is an important tool for interpreting observed genomic data in an infectious disease outbreak setting, in order to test hypotheses and to explore the range of outcomes consistent with a given set of parameters. We introduce 'seedy', an R package for the simulation of evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seedy/). Our software implements stochastic models for the accumulation of mutations within hosts, as well as individual-level disease transmission. By allowing variables such as the transmission bottleneck size, within-host effective population size and population mixing rates to be specified by the user, our package offers a flexible framework to investigate evolutionary dynamics during disease outbreaks. Furthermore, our software provides theoretical pairwise genetic distance distributions to provide a likelihood of person-to-person transmission based on genomic observations, and using this framework, implements transmission route assessment for genomic data collected during an outbreak. Our open source software provides an accessible platform for users to explore pathogen evolution and outbreak dynamics via simulation, and offers tools to assess observed genomic data in this context.",2015

Metagenomics is the analysis of DNA sequences from a population of microorganisms in a particular environment, followed by the computational reconstruction of the data to determine what organisms are present and predict their role in the environment. Defining the microbial populations associated with humans, animals, and their environment provides insight into the structure of microbial communities in any particular niche, including the abundance, diversity, and composition of the microbes and viruses present. It can also reveal the distribution of virulence genes within that niche.

However, some controversies persist regarding the contribution of each evolutionary force to the development of particular phenotypic observations (e.g., drug resistance). In this study, we revise the importance of mutation and recombination in the evolution of pathogens at both intra-host and inter-host levels. We also describe state-of-the-art analytical methodologies to detect and quantify these two evolutionary forces, including biases that are often ignored in evolutionary studies. Finally, we present some of our former studies involving pathogenic taxa where mutation and recombination played crucial roles in the recovery of pathogenic fitness, the generation of interspecific genetic diversity, or the design of centralized vaccines.

We aimed to test this hypothesis by searching for metagenomic and genomic evidences in the SMS-microbiome of a model fish species (Anguilla Anguilla or eel), from different ecosystems (four natural environments of different water salinity and one eel farm) as well as the water microbiome (W-microbiome) surrounding the host. RESULTS: Remarkably, potentially pathogenic Vibrio monopolized wild eel SMS-microbiome from natural ecosystems, Vibrio anguillarum/Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae/Vibrio metoecus being the most abundant ones in SMS from estuary and lake, respectively. Functions encoded in the SMS-microbiome differed significantly from those in the W-microbiome and allowed us to predict that successful mucus colonizers should have specific genes for (i) attachment (mainly by forming biofilms), (ii) bacterial competence and communication, and (iii) resistance to mucosal innate immunity, predators (amoeba), and heavy metals/drugs. In addition, we found several mobile genetic elements (mainly integrative conjugative elements) as well as a series of evidences suggesting that bacteria exchange DNA in SMS. Further, we isolated and sequenced a V. metoecus strain from SMS. This isolate shares pathogenicity islands with V. cholerae O1 from intestinal infections that are absent in the rest of sequenced V. metoecus strains, all of them from water and extra-intestinal infections. CONCLUSIONS: We have obtained metagenomic and genomic evidence in favor of the hypothesis on the role of fish mucosal surfaces as a specialized habitat selecting microbes capable of colonizing and persisting on other comparable mucosal surfaces, e.g., the human intestine.",2017 Dec 21

Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) was detected in 514/2,230 (23%) of HFMD patients admitted to 3 major hospitals in southern Vietnam during 2011-2015. Of these patients, 93 (18%) had severe HFMD. Phylogenetic analysis of 98 genome sequences revealed they belonged to cluster A and had been circulating in Vietnam for 2 years before emergence. CV-A6 movement among localities within Vietnam occurred frequently, whereas viral movement across international borders appeared rare. Skyline plots identified fluctuations in the relative genetic diversity of CV-A6 corresponding to large CV-A6-associated HFMD outbreaks worldwide. These data show that CV-A6 is an emerging pathogen and emphasize the necessity of active surveillance and understanding the mechanisms that shape the pathogen evolution and emergence, which is essential for development and implementation of intervention strategies.",2018 Apr
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",29668677,Bayesian reconstruction of transmission within outbreaks using genomic variants.,PLoS computational biology,"Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.",2018 Apr

Enhancing global capacity to study and interpret infectious disease surveillance data, and to develop data-driven computational models to guide policy, represents one of the most cost-effective, and yet overlooked, ways to prepare for the next pandemic. Epidemiological and behavioral data from recent pandemics and historic scourges have provided rich opportunities for validation of computational models, while new sequencing technologies and the 'big data' revolution present new tools for studying the epidemiology of outbreaks in real time. For the past two decades, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) of the NIH Fogarty International Center has spearheaded two synergistic programs to better understand and devise control strategies for global infectious disease threats. The Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS) has strengthened global capacity to study the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in 80 countries by organizing international research activities and training workshops. The Research and Policy in Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) program and its precursor activities has established a network of global experts in infectious disease modeling operating at the research-policy interface, with collaborators in 78 countries. These activities have provided evidence-based recommendations for disease control, including during large-scale outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika virus. Together, these programs have coordinated international collaborative networks to advance the study of emerging disease threats and the field of computational epidemic modeling. A global community of researchers and policy-makers have used the tools and trainings developed by these programs to interpret infectious disease patterns in their countries, understand modeling concepts, and inform control policies. Here we reflect on the scientific achievements and lessons learnt from these programs (h-index = 106 for RAPIDD and 79 for MISMS), including the identification of outstanding researchers and fellows; funding flexibility for timely research workshops and working groups (particularly relative to more traditional investigator-based grant programs); emphasis on group activities such as large-scale modeling reviews, model comparisons, forecasting challenges and special journal issues; strong quality control with a light touch on outputs; and prominence of training, data-sharing, and joint publications.",2019 Mar

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",31095555,Evolution of major histocompatibility complex gene copy number.,PLoS computational biology,"MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from ""Hamilton-Zuk"" theory of sexual selection.",2019 May

The sensitivity and specificity of viral high-throughput sequence data analysis are highly affected by bioinformatics processing using publicly available and custom tools and databases and thus differ widely between individuals and institutions. Here we present the results of the COMPARE [Collaborative Management Platform for Detection and Analyses of (Re-)emerging and Foodborne Outbreaks in Europe] in silico virus proficiency test. An artificial, simulated in silico data set of Illumina HiSeq sequences was provided to 13 different European institutes for bioinformatics analysis to identify viral pathogens in high-throughput sequence data. Comparison of the participants' analyses shows that the use of different tools, programs, and databases for bioinformatics analyses can impact the correct identification of viral sequences from a simple data set. The identification of slightly mutated and highly divergent virus genomes has been shown to be most challenging. Furthermore, the interpretation of the results, together with a fictitious case report, by the participants showed that in addition to the bioinformatics analysis, the virological evaluation of the results can be important in clinical settings. External quality assessment and proficiency testing should become an important part of validating high-throughput sequencing-based virus diagnostics and could improve the harmonization, comparability, and reproducibility of results. There is a need for the establishment of international proficiency testing, like that established for conventional laboratory tests such as PCR, for bioinformatics pipelines and the interpretation of such results.",2019 Aug

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",31454306,Gauging the epidemic potential of a widely circulating non-invasive meningococcal strain in Africa.,Microbial genomics,"Neisseria meningitidis colonizes the human oropharynx and transmits mainly via asymptomatic carriage. Actual outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are comparatively rare and occur when susceptible populations are exposed to hypervirulent clones, genetically distinct from the main carriage isolates. However, carriage isolates can evolve into pathogens through a limited number of recombination events. The present study examines the potential for the sequence type (ST)-192, by far the dominant clone recovered in recent meningococcal carriage studies in sub-Saharan Africa, to evolve into a pathogen. We used whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 478 meningococcal isolates sampled from 1- to 29- year-old healthy individuals in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia in 2014. The ST-192 clone was identified in nearly 60 % of the carriers. Using complementary short- and long-read techniques for whole-genome sequencing, we were able to completely resolve genomes and thereby identify genomic differences between the ST-192 carriage strain and known pathogenic clones with the highest possible resolution. We conclude that it is possible, but unlikely, that ST-192 could evolve into a significant pathogen, thus, becoming the major invasive meningococcus clone in the meningitis belt of Africa following upcoming mass vaccination with a polyvalent conjugate vaccine that targets the A, C, W, Y and X capsules.",2019 Aug

After its first detection in New York in 1999, West Nile virus quickly spread across the continent, causing an epidemic of human disease and massive bird die-offs. Now the virus has become endemic to the United States, where an estimated 7 million human infections have occurred, making it the leading mosquito-borne virus infection and the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the country. To bring new attention to one of the most important mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas, we provide an interactive review using Nextstrain: a visualization tool for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution (nextstrain.org/WNV/NA). Nextstrain utilizes a growing database of more than 2,000 West Nile virus genomes and harnesses the power of phylogenetics for students, educators, public health workers, and researchers to visualize key aspects of virus spread and evolution. Using Nextstrain, we use virus genomics to investigate the emergence of West Nile virus in the U S, followed by its rapid spread, evolution in a new environment, establishment of endemic transmission, and subsequent international spread. For each figure, we include a link to Nextstrain to allow the readers to directly interact with and explore the underlying data in new ways. We also provide a brief online narrative that parallels this review to further explain the data and highlight key epidemiological and evolutionary features (nextstrain.org/narratives/twenty-years-of-WNV). Mirroring the dynamic nature of outbreaks, the Nextstrain links provided within this paper are constantly updated as new West Nile virus genomes are shared publicly, helping to stay current with the research. Overall, our review showcases how genomics can track West Nile virus spread and evolution, as well as potentially uncover novel targeted control measures to help alleviate its public health burden.",2019 Oct
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",31703933,Surfaceome analysis of Australian epidemic Bordetella pertussis reveals potential vaccine antigens.,Vaccine,"Since acellular vaccines (ACV) were introduced in Australia, epidemic Bordetella pertussis strains changed from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cluster II to SNP cluster I. Our previous proteomic analysis identified potential proteomic adaptations in the whole cell and secretome of SNP cluster I. Additionally, current ACVs were shown to be less efficacious against cluster I in mice models and there is a pressing need to discover new antigens to improve the ACV. One important source of novel antigens is the surfaceome. Therefore, in this study we established surface shaving in B. pertussis to compare the surfaceome of SNP cluster I (L1423) and II (L1191), and identify novel surface antigens for vaccine development. Surface shaving using 1 mug of trypsin for 5 min identified 126 proteins with the most abundant being virulence-associated and known outer membrane proteins. Cell viability counts showed minimal lysis from shaving. The proportion of immunogenic proteins was higher in the surfaceome than in the whole cell and secretome. Key differences in the surfaceome were identified between SNP cluster I and II, consistent with those identified in the whole cell proteome and secretome. These differences include unique transport proteins and decreased immunogenic proteins in L1423, and provides further evidence of proteomic adaptation in SNP cluster I. Finally, a comparison of proteins in each sub-proteome identified 22 common proteins. These included 11 virulence proteins (Prn, PtxA, FhaB, CyaA, TcfA, SphB1, Vag8, BrkA, BopD, Bsp22 and BipA) and 11 housekeeping proteins (TuF, CtpA, TsF, OmpH, GltA, SucC, SucD, FusA, GroEL, BP3330 and BP3561) which were immunogenic, essential and consistently expressed thus demonstrating their potential as future targets. This study established surface shaving in B. pertussis, confirmed key expression differences and identified unknown surface proteins which may be potential vaccine antigens.",2020 Jan 16
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",32213253,Deciphering the role of insertion sequences in the evolution of bacterial epidemic pathogens with panISa software.,Microbial genomics,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in microbiology to explore genome evolution and the structure of pathogen outbreaks. Bioinformatics pipelines readily detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms or short indels. However, bacterial genomes also evolve through the action of small transposable elements called insertion sequences (ISs), which are difficult to detect due to their short length and multiple repetitions throughout the genome. We designed panISa software for the ab initio detection of IS insertions in the genomes of prokaryotes. PanISa has been released as open source software (GPL3) available from https://github.com/bvalot/panISa. In this study, we assessed the utility of this software for evolutionary studies, by reanalysing five published datasets for outbreaks of human major pathogens in which ISs had not been specifically investigated. We reanalysed the raw data from each study, by aligning the reads against reference genomes and running panISa on the alignments. Each hit was automatically curated and IS-related events were validated on the basis of nucleotide sequence similarity, by comparison with the ISFinder database. In Acinetobacter baumannii, the panISa pipeline identified ISAba1 or ISAba125 upstream from the ampC gene, which encodes a cephalosporinase in all third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates. In the genomes of Vibrio cholerae isolates, we found that early Haitian isolates had the same ISs as Nepalese isolates, confirming the inferred history of the contamination of this island. In Enterococcus faecalis, panISa identified regions of high plasticity, including a pathogenicity island enriched in IS-related events. The overall distribution of ISs deduced with panISa was consistent with SNP-based phylogenic trees, for all species considered. The role of ISs in pathogen evolution has probably been underestimated due to difficulties detecting these transposable elements. We show here that panISa is a useful addition to the bioinformatics toolbox for analyses of the evolution of bacterial genomes. PanISa will facilitate explorations of the functional impact of ISs and improve our understanding of prokaryote evolution.",2020 Jun

Since 1999, canine H3 influenza A viruses (CIVs) have caused many thousands or millions of respiratory infections in dogs in the United States. While no human infections with CIVs have been reported to date, these viruses could pose a zoonotic risk. In these studies, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) network collaboratively demonstrated that CIVs replicated in some primary human cells and transmitted effectively in mammalian models. While people born after 1970 had little or no pre-existing humoral immunity against CIVs, the viruses were sensitive to existing antivirals and we identified a panel of H3 cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that could have prophylactic and/or therapeutic value. Our data predict these CIVs posed a low risk to humans. Importantly, we showed that the CEIRS network could work together to provide basic research information important for characterizing emerging influenza viruses, although there were valuable lessons learned.",2020 Apr

Hybrid isolates that differ from their parental species in infection-relevant traits have been observed in several human-pathogenic yeasts and plant-pathogenic filamentous fungi but have yet to be found in human-pathogenic filamentous fungi. We discovered 6 clinical isolates from patients with aspergillosis originally identified as Aspergillus nidulans (section Nidulantes) that are actually allodiploid hybrids formed by the fusion of Aspergillus spinulosporus with an unknown close relative of Aspergillus quadrilineatus, both in section Nidulantes. Evolutionary genomic analyses revealed that these isolates belong to Aspergillus latus, an allodiploid hybrid species. Characterization of diverse infection-relevant traits further showed that A. latus hybrid isolates are genomically and phenotypically heterogeneous but also differ from A. nidulans, A. spinulosporus, and A. quadrilineatus. These results suggest that allodiploid hybridization contributes to the genomic and phenotypic diversity of filamentous fungal pathogens of humans.",2020 Jul 6

Its occurrence as a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a singular case in animal virology for which no consensus evolutionary explanation exists. Here we present a mammalian deltavirus that does not occur in humans, identified in the neotropical rodent species Proechimys semispinosus The rodent deltavirus is highly distinct, showing a common ancestor with a recently described deltavirus in snakes. Reverse genetics based on a tandem minus-strand complementary DNA genome copy under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter confirms autonomous genome replication in transfected cells, with initiation of replication from the upstream genome copy. In contrast to HDV, a large delta antigen is not expressed and the farnesylation motif critical for HBV interaction is absent from a genome region that might correspond to a hypothetical rodent large delta antigen. Correspondingly, there is no evidence for coinfection with an HBV-related hepadnavirus based on virus detection and serology in any deltavirus-positive animal. No other coinfecting viruses were detected by RNA sequencing studies of 120 wild-caught animals that could serve as a potential helper virus. The presence of virus in blood and pronounced detection in reproductively active males suggest horizontal transmission linked to competitive behavior. Our study establishes a nonhuman, mammalian deltavirus that occurs as a horizontally transmitted infection, is potentially cleared by immune response, is not focused in the liver, and possibly does not require helper virus coinfection.",2020 Jul 28

The origins and spread of treponemal diseases remain unresolved, including syphilis' potential introduction into Europe from the Americas. Here, we present the first genetic data from archaeological human remains reflecting a high diversity of Treponema pallidum in early modern Europe. Our study demonstrates that a variety of strains related to both venereal syphilis and yaws-causing T. pallidum subspecies were already present in Northern Europe in the early modern period.

Analyses of the microbiome of ancient human samples may provide insights into human health and disease, as well as pathogen evolution, but the field is still in its very early stages and considered highly challenging. RESULTS: The metagenomic and pathogen content of Egyptian mummified individuals from different time periods was investigated via genetic analysis of the microbial composition of various tissues. The analysis of the dental calculus' microbiome identified Red Complex bacteria, which are correlated with periodontal diseases. From bone and soft tissue, genomes of two ancient pathogens, a 2200-year-old Mycobacterium leprae strain and a 2000-year-old human hepatitis B virus, were successfully reconstructed.

Series B, Biological sciences","Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has been prevalent among humans for at least 5000 years, being accountable for several devastating epidemics in history, including the Black Death. Analyses of the genetic diversity of ancient strains of Y. pestis have shed light on the mechanisms of evolution and the spread of plague in Europe. However, many questions regarding the origins of the pathogen and its long persistence in Europe are still unresolved, especially during the late medieval time period. To address this, we present four newly assembled Y. pestis genomes from Eastern Europe (Poland and Southern Russia), dating from the fifteenth to eighteenth century AD. The analysis of polymorphisms in these genomes and their phylogenetic relationships with other ancient and modern Y. pestis strains may suggest several independent introductions of plague into Eastern Europe or its persistence in different reservoirs. Furthermore, with the reconstruction of a partial Y. pestis genome from rat skeletal remains found in a Polish ossuary, we were able to identify a potential animal reservoir in late medieval Europe. Overall, our results add new information concerning Y. pestis transmission and its evolutionary history in Eastern Europe.

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",33024045,Survival Strategies of Pathogenic Candida Species in Human Blood Show Independent and Specific Adaptations.,mBio,"Only four species, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, together account for about 90% of all Candida bloodstream infections and are among the most common causes of invasive fungal infections of humans. However, virulence potential varies among these species, and the phylogenetic tree reveals that their pathogenicity may have emerged several times independently during evolution. We therefore tested these four species in a human whole-blood infection model to determine, via comprehensive dual-species RNA-sequencing analyses, which fungal infection strategies are conserved and which are recent evolutionary developments. The ex vivo infection progressed from initial immune cell interactions to nearly complete killing of all fungal cells. During the course of infection, we characterized important parameters of pathogen-host interactions, such as fungal survival, types of interacting immune cells, and cytokine release. On the transcriptional level, we obtained a predominantly uniform and species-independent human response governed by a strong upregulation of proinflammatory processes, which was downregulated at later time points after most of the fungal cells were killed. In stark contrast, we observed that the different fungal species pursued predominantly individual strategies and showed significantly different global transcriptome patterns. Among other findings, our functional analyses revealed that the fungal species relied on different metabolic pathways and virulence factors to survive the host-imposed stress. These data show that adaptation of Candida species as a response to the host is not a phylogenetic trait, but rather has likely evolved independently as a prerequisite to cause human infections.IMPORTANCE To ensure their survival, pathogens have to adapt immediately to new environments in their hosts, for example, during the transition from the gut to the bloodstream. Here, we investigated the basis of this adaptation in a group of fungal species which are among the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections, the Candida species. On the basis of a human whole-blood infection model, we studied which genes and processes are active over the course of an infection in both the host and four different Candida pathogens. Remarkably, we found that, while the human host response during the early phase of infection is predominantly uniform, the pathogens pursue largely individual strategies and each one regulates genes involved in largely disparate processes in the blood. Our results reveal that C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis all have developed individual strategies for survival in the host. This indicates that their pathogenicity in humans has evolved several times independently and that genes which are central for survival in the host for one species may be irrelevant in another.",2020 Oct 6

Whole-genome sequencing showed that historic and recent isolates of B. pertussis have substantial variation in genome organization and form separate phylogenetic clusters. Subsequent RNA sequence analysis and liquid chromatography with mass tandem spectrometry analyses showed that these variations translated into discretely separated transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. When compared with historic strains, recent isolates showed increased expression of flagellar genes and genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and decreased expression of polysaccharide capsule genes.

Evidence suggests that influenza virus variants are more prevalent in pregnant and/or obese individuals due to their impaired interferon response. We have recently shown that the non-allergic, paucigranulocytic subtype of asthma is associated with impaired type I interferon production. Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that at least a subset of patients with asthma may be more susceptible to severe influenza and may be a possible source of new influenza virus variants.",2021 Feb 16

The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here, we propose an alternative, reproducible, and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high-frequency genetic variants, fall into four major macrohaplogroups. We highlight biased spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that seven of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the four haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognized-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3'-UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. Although several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.",2021 May 19
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",33617114,Genomic Epidemiology Analysis of Infectious Disease Outbreaks Using TransPhylo.,Current protocols,"Comparing the pathogen genomes from several cases of an infectious disease has the potential to help us understand and control outbreaks. Many methods exist to reconstruct a phylogeny from such genomes, which represents how the genomes are related to one another. However, such a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events between individuals. TransPhylo is a software tool implemented as an R package designed to bridge the gap between pathogen phylogenies and transmission trees. TransPhylo is based on a combined model of transmission between hosts and pathogen evolution within each host. It can simulate both phylogenies and transmission trees jointly under this combined model. TransPhylo can also reconstruct a transmission tree based on a dated phylogeny, by exploring the space of transmission trees compatible with the phylogeny. A transmission tree can be represented as a coloring of a phylogeny where each color represents a different host of the pathogen, and TransPhylo provides convenient ways to plot these colorings and explore the results. This article presents the basic protocols that can be used to make the most of TransPhylo. (c) 2021 The Authors.

To date, quantifying the spread of infectious diseases to inform policy making has traditionally relied on epidemiological data collected during epidemics. However, interest has grown in recent phylodynamic techniques to infer pathogen transmission dynamics from genetic data. Here, we provide examples of where this new discipline has enhanced disease management in public health and illustrate how it could be further applied in animal health. In particular, we describe how phylodynamics can address fundamental epidemiological questions, such as inferring key transmission parameters in animal populations and quantifying spillover events at the wildlife-livestock interface, and generate important insights for the design of more effective control strategies.",2021 Sep

Researchers increasingly depend on the outputs of these tools to infer transmission dynamics of human diseases and make actionable recommendations to public health officials (Black et al., 2020; Gardy et al., 2015). In order to enable real-time analyses of pathogen evolution, bioinformatics tools must scale rapidly with the number of samples and be flexible enough to adapt to a variety of questions and organisms.

In Cyprus, the first two cases of COVID-19 were identified on March 9, 2020 and since then 33,567 confirmed cases and 230 deaths were documented. In this study, viral whole genome sequencing was performed on 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected between March 2020 and January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the genomic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus. 15 different lineages were identified that clustered into three groups associated with the spring, summer and autumn/winter wave of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Cyprus, respectively. The majority of the Cypriot samples belonged to the B.1.258 lineage first detected in September that spread rapidly and largely dominated the autumn/winter wave with a peak prevalence of 86% during the months of November and December. The B.1.1.7 UK variant (VOC-202012/01) was identified for the first time at the end of December and spread rapidly reaching 37% prevalence within one month. Overall, we describe the changing pattern of circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Cyprus since the beginning of the pandemic until the end of January 2021. These findings highlight the role of importation of new variants through travel towards the emergence of successive waves of incidence in Cyprus and demonstrate the importance of genomic surveillance in determining viral genetic diversity and the timely identification of new variants for guiding public health intervention measures.",2021
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",34312522,Bottleneck size and selection level reproducibly impact evolution of antibiotic resistance.,Nature ecology & evolution,"During antibiotic treatment, the evolution of bacterial pathogens is fundamentally affected by bottlenecks and varying selection levels imposed by the drugs. Bottlenecks-that is, reductions in bacterial population size-lead to an increased influence of random effects (genetic drift) during bacterial evolution, and varying antibiotic concentrations during treatment may favour distinct resistance variants. Both aspects influence the process of bacterial evolution during antibiotic therapy and thereby treatment outcome. Surprisingly, the joint influence of these interconnected factors on the evolution of antibiotic resistance remains largely unexplored. Here we combine evolution experiments with genomic and genetic analyses to demonstrate that bottleneck size and antibiotic-induced selection reproducibly impact the evolutionary path to resistance in pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most problematic opportunistic human pathogens. Resistance is favoured-expectedly-under high antibiotic selection and weak bottlenecks, but-unexpectedly-also under low antibiotic selection and severe bottlenecks. The latter is likely to result from a reduced probability of losing favourable variants through drift under weak selection. Moreover, the absence of high resistance under low selection and weak bottlenecks is caused by the spread of low-resistance variants with high competitive fitness under these conditions. We conclude that bottlenecks, in combination with drug-induced selection, are currently neglected key determinants of pathogen evolution and outcome of antibiotic treatment.",2021 Sep
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",34490415,Increased risk of severe clinical course of COVID-19 in carriers of HLA-C*04:01.,EClinicalMedicine,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing urgency to identify pathophysiological characteristics leading to severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors that affect individual immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting a multicenter study using HLA sequencing. METHODS: We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and HLAs in 435 individuals from Germany (n = 135), Spain (n = 133), Switzerland (n = 20) and the United States (n = 147), who had been enrolled from March 2020 to August 2020. This study included patients older than 18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 and representing the full spectrum of the disease. Finally, we tested our results by meta-analysing data from prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS). FINDINGS: We describe a potential association of HLA-C*04:01 with severe clinical course of COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C*04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio 1.5 [95% CI 1.1-2.1], odds ratio 3.5 [95% CI 1.9-6.6], adjusted p-value = 0.0074). These findings are based on data from four countries and corroborated by independent results from GWAS. Our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C*04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites for relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides compared to other HLA alleles. INTERPRETATION: HLA-C*04:01 carrier state is associated with severe clinical course in SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that HLA class I alleles have a relevant role in immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. FUNDING: Funded by Roche Sequencing Solutions, Inc.",2021 Oct

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are also classified as beta-coronavirus. New SARS-CoV-2 spike genomic variants are responsible for human-to-human and interspecies transmissibility, consequences of adaptations of strains from animals to humans. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to receptor ACE2 in humans and animal species with high affinity, suggesting there have been adaptive genomic variants. New genomic variants including the incorporation, replacement, or deletion of the amino acids at a variety of positions in the S protein have been documented and are associated with the emergence of new strains adapted to different hosts. Interactions between mutated residues and RBD have been demonstrated by structural modelling of variants including D614G, B.1.1.7, B1.351, P.1, P2; other genomic variants allow escape from antibodies generated by vaccines. Epidemiological and molecular tools are being used for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution and particularly new SARS-CoV-2 variants. COVID-19 vaccines obtained from classical and next-generation vaccine production platforms have entered clinicals trials.

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",36386655,A novel T4- and lambda-based receptor binding protein family for bacteriophage therapy host range engineering.,Frontiers in microbiology,"Widespread multidrug antimicrobial resistance in emerging pathogens has led to a renewed interest in phage therapy as an alternative or supplement to traditional small molecule drugs. The primary limiting factors of phage therapy deployment rest in the narrow host range specificity of phage as well as a poor understanding of many phages' unintended downstream effects on host physiology and microbiota as well as on adverse pathogen evolution. Consequently, this has made assembling well-defined and safe ""phage-cocktails"" of solely naturally occurring phages labor- and time-intensive. To increase the speed, efficacy, and safety of therapeutic deployment, there is exceptional interest in modulating the host ranges of well-characterized lytic phages (e.g., T4 and T7) by using synthetic strategies to the swap phage tail components, the receptor binding proteins (RBPs) key for host specificity. Here we identify the RBP of the Citrobacter rodentium temperate phage PhiNP as ORF6. Through bioinformatic and phylogenetic assays, we demonstrate this RBP to be closely related to the known RBPs of T4 and lambda. Further investigation reveals a novel, greater than 200 members RBP family with phages targeting several notable human pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. With well characterized lytic members, this RBP family represents an ideal candidate for use in synthetic strategies for expanding therapeutic phage host ranges.",2022

Methods: For virulent ABC importers from M. abscessus predicted by orthology and phylogeny analysis of nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. abscessus, and M. tuberculosis, the antibiotic susceptibility of overexpression transformant and knockout mutant was assayed after confirmation by in vitro experiment. Results: Three-domain importers were dominant ones in M. abscessus (60.0%), four-domain ones dominant in M. tuberculosis (87.5%), whereas both types were same in M. smegmatis (41.9%). In the phylogenetic tree, the importers of M. abscessus (53.3%) and M. tuberculosis (62.5%) were mainly distributed in clay A, whereas the clay E was exclusively composed of M. smegmatis NBDs, which hinted possible reprogramming of the transporter system during the pathogen evolution. In clay A, MAB_2178 and others were predicted virulence-associated because of high sequence similarity to M. tuberculosis virulence importers. Conclusions: The importance and complexity of antibiotics resistance mechanisms of MAB_2176-2177-2178 were pointed out by its overexpression enhancing bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, cefoxitin, and sensitivity to amikacin, and knockout having opposite phenotypes.",2022 Dec
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",36752777,Identification of genes influencing the evolution of Escherichia coli ST372 in dogs and humans.,Microbial genomics,"ST372 are widely reported as the major Escherichia coli sequence type in dogs globally. They are also a sporadic cause of extraintestinal infections in humans. Despite this, it is unknown whether ST372 strains from dogs and humans represent shared or distinct populations. Furthermore, little is known about genomic traits that might explain the prominence of ST372 in dogs or presence in humans. To address this, we applied a variety of bioinformatics analyses to a global collection of 407 ST372 E. coli whole-genome sequences to characterize their epidemiological features, population structure and associated accessory genomes. We confirm that dogs are the dominant host of ST372 and that clusters within the population structure exhibit distinctive O:H types. One phylogenetic cluster, 'cluster M', comprised almost half of the sequences and showed the divergence of two human-restricted clades that carried different O:H types to the remainder of the cluster. We also present evidence supporting transmission between dogs and humans within different clusters of the phylogeny, including M. We show that multiple acquisitions of the pdu propanediol utilization operon have occurred in clusters dominated by isolates of canine source, possibly linked to diet, whereas loss of the pdu operon and acquisition of K antigen virulence genes characterize human-restricted lineages.",2023 Feb

Emergence of many SARS-CoV-2 lineages has been associated with enhancements in their ability to evade population immunity resulting from both vaccination and infection. Here we show diverging trends of escape from vaccine-derived and infection-derived immunity for the emerging XBB/XBB.1.5 Omicron lineage. Among 31,739 patients tested in ambulatory settings in Southern California from December, 2022 to February, 2023, adjusted odds of prior receipt of 2, 3, 4, and >/=5 COVID-19 vaccine doses were 10% (95% confidence interval: 1-18%), 11% (3-19%), 13% (3-21%), and 25% (15-34%) lower, respectively, among cases infected with XBB/XBB.1.5 than among cases infected with other co-circulating lineages. Similarly, prior vaccination was associated with greater point estimates of protection against progression to hospitalization among cases with XBB/XBB.1.5 than among non-XBB/XBB.1.5 cases (70% [30-87%] and 48% [7-71%], respectively, for recipients of >/=4 doses). In contrast, cases infected with XBB/XBB.1.5 had 17% (11-24%) and 40% (19-65%) higher adjusted odds of having experienced 1 and >/=2 prior documented infections, respectively, including with pre-Omicron variants. As immunity acquired from SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes increasingly widespread, fitness costs associated with enhanced vaccine sensitivity in XBB/XBB.1.5 may be offset by increased ability to evade infection-derived host responses.",2023 Jun 29
"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",37646506,Rapid and strain-specific resistance evolution of Staphylococcus aureus against inhibitory molecules secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,mBio,"Polymicrobial infections are common. In chronic infections, the different pathogens may repeatedly interact, which could spur evolutionary dynamics with pathogens adapting to one another. Here, we explore the potential of Staphylococcus aureus to adapt to its competitor Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These two pathogens frequently co-occur, and P. aeruginosa is seen as the dominant species being able to displace S. aureus. We studied three different S. aureus strains and found that all became quickly resistant to inhibitory compounds secreted by P. aeruginosa. Our experimental evolution revealed strains-specific adaptations with three main factors contributing to resistance evolution: (i) overproduction of staphyloxanthin, a molecule protecting from oxidative stress; (ii) the formation of small colony variants also protecting from oxidative stress; and (iii) alterations of membrane transporters possibly reducing toxin uptake. Our results show that species interactions can change over time potentially favoring species co-existence, which in turn could affect disease progression and treatment options.",2023 Oct 31

Recently, ancient DNA evidence has revealed various treponemal infections circulating in early modern Europe and colonial-era Mexico(3-6). However, there has been to our knowledge no genomic evidence of treponematosis recovered from either the Americas or the Old World that can be reliably dated to the time before the first trans-Atlantic contacts. Here, we present treponemal genomes from nearly 2,000-year-old human remains from Brazil. We reconstruct four ancient genomes of a prehistoric treponemal pathogen, most closely related to the bejel-causing agent Treponema pallidum endemicum. Contradicting the modern day geographical niche of bejel in the arid regions of the world, the results call into question the previous palaeopathological characterization of treponeme subspecies and showcase their adaptive potential. A high-coverage genome is used to improve molecular clock date estimations, placing the divergence of modern T. pallidum subspecies firmly in pre-Columbian times. Overall, our study demonstrates the opportunities within archaeogenetics to uncover key events in pathogen evolution and emergence, paving the way to new hypotheses on the origin and spread of treponematoses.",2024 Mar

"Human AND ""Pathogen Evolution"" AND Bioinformatics",39241101,Fitness models provide accurate short-term forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency.,PLoS computational biology,"Genomic surveillance of pathogen evolution is essential for public health response, treatment strategies, and vaccine development. In the context of SARS-COV-2, multiple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) describing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing variant Rt. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time forecasts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy highlights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides  approximately 0.6% median absolute error and  approximately 6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term forecasts. We conclude that fitness models represent a useful prognostic tool for short-term evolutionary forecasting.",2024 Sep
